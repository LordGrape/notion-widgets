# Command Centre

Private installable Progressive Web App (PWA) for coordinating Notion, law school, and the rest of Musbah's operating system.

## Product role

Command Centre is a companion to Notion, not a replacement for it. Notion remains the source of truth for detailed knowledge, databases, and planning. Command Centre provides the daily execution layer:

- prioritized tasks and concise briefings
- a dedicated Queen's Law view
- a whole-life view covering military, fitness, administration, and personal work
- focused access to every existing widget
- a command surface that can grow into a secure conversational assistant

## Privacy model

The interface is publicly downloadable because it is hosted from a public GitHub repository. Private data is not included in the repository or static application bundle.

On first launch, the application requires the Cloudflare Worker access key and verifies it against the protected `/state/user` route. After successful verification, the key is remembered in browser-local storage and copied into the active session on later launches. Choosing **Lock Command Centre** deletes both copies. Every state request sends the key through the `X-Widget-Key` header over HTTPS.

This is durable browser storage rather than a server cookie. It provides the requested one-time unlock on that browser without placing the key in GitHub or the application bundle.

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and operational rules.

## Notion bridge

Tasks continue to synchronize through the Action Blocks database. Command Centre also expands the next 21 days of recurring timetable blocks and upserts them into the separate **Widget Timetable** Notion database. The database includes a calendar view, so Notion AI can answer questions using the same task and timetable information shown by the widgets.

The bridge runs after Command Centre opens, every five minutes while it remains open, and when the application regains focus. The Cloudflare Worker performs all Notion writes so the Notion token never reaches the browser.

## Data boundaries

Tasks, focus records, timetable data, and user data remain under their existing namespaces. Command Centre reads those boundaries without creating a competing private store. The Notion databases are queryable mirrors for Notion AI and calendar views.
